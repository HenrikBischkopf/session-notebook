This is the Readme. Please read me.

trying to collect some useful informations, shortcuts and commands to implement branches to git, as teached today by coachS Dominik.

Pull Request/ Review Process are the most important part of the branch. Its the last step before merging back with the working main branch. This pull request must be free of errors so the main branch still works fluently and faultless.

git switch -c "text" will create a new branch with name text and switch to it immediatly.

you must then use the git commands in your terminal to add files to git. After that create a repository on Git with the same name and push the content to Git in the terminal.
